             <h1>What is SEO ?</h1>
             <p>
                Search Engine Optimisation : basically make sure your website doesn't get put in google's page 2 and get ignored or the rest of it's lifetime
             </p>


             <h1>How do Search Engines work?</h1>
             <p>
                1-semantic HTML, use strong and not css, tags are the important thing
                2-different places have different weights (title>heading>paragraph)
                3-google formula != yahoo formula != bing formula etc..
             </p>


             <h1>How to test </h1>
             <p>Incognito mode</p>


             <h1>what to do </h1>
                <h2>1- help bots, spiders and crawlers:</h2>
                <p>
                    1-they go through links, so if you have URLs that are not accessible through links, they won't find this
                    2-a lot of your important content shouldn't be behind log-ins and accounts since bots can't fill forms or make accounts
                    3-they can't read text inside images &amp; logos (they may can, google is intelligent as fuck) but try not to
                    4-the more a certain keyword combination is repeated, they more likely they will put your website in "relevant" to the query
                </p>
                

                <h2>2- Domain Names &mp; URLS:</h2>
                <p>
                    1-if query is "lorem", they will search for "lorem.com","lorem.net" etc.. Domain names come first
                    2-ba3d ichouf il query fil URL, "7aja.com/lorem" BICH tjik.
                    3-depth of directory , the further you get away from your home page means it's less important, so  "7aja.com/lorem" > "7aja.com/users/lorem" > "7aja.com/users/profile/page/lorem"
                </p>
                

                <h2>3- Title and Meta Description:</h2>
                <p>
                    1-those blue links in google earch are the titles,each page has it's title, and  each title should contain the name of your website and a description of what THAT page does, otherwise "forum" and "profiles" will be seen as the same
                    2-title names < 60-65 characters
                    3-names come first : "name - website name", because people are looking for a certain name
                    3-titles musn't be nonsense and random keywords, they must have sense and make the person want to click it

                    4-meta data are your friend, especially description < 160 charas
                    5-keywords once in title and once or both in description , both readable for humans, attention grabbing and not too long
                </p>
            
                <h2>4- Headings &amp; images:</h2>
                <p>
                    1- h1>h2>h3>h4>h5>h6 : the bigger the mor important, choose wisely and know what to write in them
                    2- write alt attributes, bots can't read images, give a good description
                </p>
                
                <h2>5- body content:</h2>
                <p>
                    1- the more a keyword is present in your website the better, but overusing it will cause harm because 1: it's unreadable to humans and 2: search engines know you're doing this and won't let you go to the top, this keyword abuse is called "keyword Stuffing"

                    2- if you have an article about X things that are related, make them in one big page instead of X pages, it's better for the search engine, and it's better for the user

                    3-if you want to rank up for a certain keyword, use it once in yout title, description and H1 tag, and use it naturally in the content, no overstressing

                    4- don't start spouting nonsense and putting keywords everywhere you can
                </p>

                <h2>6- Keyword Researching:</h2>
                <p>
                    1- do not target impossible keywords :
                        - Apple / Microsoft / Orange : huge competitors, always #1
                        - keyword that are massively competitive

                    2- target less-competitive keywords
                    3- think like a user (or common sense) : what would the user type to look for something

                    4- use autocomplete, they're there for a reason (google, youtube etc.)
                    5- some places like google, have a related or users searched also for , use it
                    6- google trends gives you what people search for, higher numbers are maybe good, but they are also more competitive
                </p>

                <h2>7- links</h2>
                <p>
                    1- the more links, the better (because bots will say there is much traffic from and to this site, so it's important)
                    2- use keywords in link names (ex: john doe on "instagram")
                    3- having links that point to your website and these links are in trustworthy websites, your ranking gets better (wikipedia,stackoverflow, .gov and .edu etc..), this is called backlink
                    4- make accounts EVERYWHERE so there are max backlinks
                    5- email blog owners or something like that so that they write about you and post a backlink on their site
                    6- if you spam, and make 50 accounts on 50 sites and post links everywhere, you'll suicide yourself
                    7- buying 10000 backlinks won't help you, search engines are intelligent, don't get that number in a day
                    8- build links to relevant pages, not just home page, depending on platform ( if you're on a pyhton website, post a link to your python content)
                </p>

                <h2>8- robots.txt</h2>
                <p>
                    1- this file lets you write rules for search engines
                    2- user agent: {names}, means your rules apply to the names written (ex: googlebot), using user agent:* means everyone
                    3- disallow : {names}, means bots cannot crawl into the directories and file names written.
                    4- beware, this file is public, so writing names in disallow that contain passwords or other stuff is a red flag for hackers.
                </p>

                <h2>9- Sitemap</h2>
                <p>
                    1- XML file containing all our web pages, and their priority, to be used by the bots.
                    2- use automated websites to do that, as it will take you years to complete one
                </p>


             <h1>Automated Websites</h1>
             <p>
                 1- varvy
                 2- siteanalyzer !important
             </p>
