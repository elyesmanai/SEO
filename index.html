             </p>


             <h1>How do Search Engines work?</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>semantic HTML, use strong and not css, tags are the important thing</li>
                    <li>different places have different weights (title>heading>paragraph)</li>
                    <li>google formula != yahoo formula != bing formula etc..</li>
                </ol>

             <h1>How to test </h1>
             <p>Incognito mode</p>


             <h1>what to do </h1>
                <h2>1- help bots, spiders and crawlers:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>they go through links, so if you have URLs that are not accessible through links, they won't find this</li>
                    <li>a lot of your important content shouldn't be behind log-ins and accounts since bots can't fill forms or make accounts</li>
                    <li>they can't read text inside images &amp; logos (they may can, google is intelligent as fuck) but try not to</li>
                    <li>the more a certain keyword combination is repeated, they more likely they will put your website in "relevant" to the query</li>
                </ol>


                <h2>2- Domain Names &mp; URLS:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>if query is "lorem", they will search for "lorem.com","lorem.net" etc.. Domain names come first</li>
                    <li>ba3d ichouf il query fil URL, "7aja.com/lorem" BICH tjik.</li>
                    <li>depth of directory , the further you get away from your home page means it's less important, so  "7aja.com/lorem" > "7aja.com/users/lorem" > "7aja.com/users/profile/page/lorem"</li>
                </ol>
            
                

                <h2>3- Title and Meta Description:</h2>
               <ol>
                   <li>those blue links in google earch are the titles,each page has it's title, and  each title should contain the name of your website and a description of what THAT page does, otherwise "forum" and "profiles" will be seen as the same</li>
                   <li>title names < 60-65 characters</li>
                   <li>names come first : "name - website name", because people are looking for a certain name</li>
                   <li>titles musn't be nonsense and random keywords, they must have sense and make the person want to click it</li>
                   <li>meta data are your friend, especially description < 160 charas</li>
                   <li>keywords once in title and once or both in description , both readable for humans, attention grabbing and not too long</li>
               </ol>
            
            
                <h2>4- Headings &amp; images:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>h1>h2>h3>h4>h5>h6 : the bigger the mor important, choose wisely and know what to write in them</li>
                    <li> write alt attributes, bots can't read images, give a good description</li>
                </ol>
                 
                
                <h2>5- body content:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li> the more a keyword is present in your website the better, but overusing it will cause harm because 1: it's unreadable to humans and 2: search engines know you're doing this and won't let you go to the top, this keyword abuse is called "keyword Stuffing"</li>
                    <li>if you have an article about X things that are related, make them in one big page instead of X pages, it's better for the search engine, and it's better for the user</li>
                    <li>if you want to rank up for a certain keyword, use it once in yout title, description and H1 tag, and use it naturally in the content, no overstressing
                    </li>
                    <li> don't start spouting nonsense and putting keywords everywhere you can</li>
                </ol>
                

                <h2>6- Keyword Researching:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>do not target impossible keywords : <br>
                        - Apple / Microsoft / Orange : huge competitors, always #1 <br>
                        - keyword that are massively competitive</li>
                    <li>target less-competitive keywords</li>
                    <li>think like a user (or common sense) : what would the user type to look for something</li>
                    <li>use autocomplete, they're there for a reason (google, youtube etc.)</li>
                    <li>some places like google, have a related or users searched also for , use it</li>
                    <li>google trends gives you what people search for, higher numbers are maybe good, but they are also more competitive</li>
                </ol>
                 

                <h2>7- links</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>the more links, the better (because bots will say there is much traffic from and to this site, so it's important)</li>
                    <li>use keywords in link names (ex: john doe on "instagram")</li>
                    <li>having links that point to your website and these links are in trustworthy websites, your ranking gets better (wikipedia,stackoverflow, .gov and .edu etc..), this is called backlink</li>
                    <li>make accounts EVERYWHERE so there are max backlinks</li>
                    <li>email blog owners or something like that so that they write about you and post a backlink on their site</li>
                    <li> if you spam, and make 50 accounts on 50 sites and post links everywhere, you'll suicide yourself</li>
                    <li>buying 10000 backlinks won't help you, search engines are intelligent, don't get that number in a day</li>
                    <li>build links to relevant pages, not just home page, depending on platform ( if you're on a pyhton website, post a link to your python content)</li>
                </ol>
                 
                <h2>8- robots.txt</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>this file lets you write rules for search engines</li>
                    <li>user agent: {names}, means your rules apply to the names written (ex: googlebot), using user agent:* means everyone</li>
                    <li>disallow : {names}, means bots cannot crawl into the directories and file names written.</li>
                    <li>beware, this file is public, so writing names in disallow that contain passwords or other stuff is a red flag for hackers.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                  

                <h2>9- Sitemap</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li> XML file containing all our web pages, and their priority, to be used by the bots.</li>
                    <li>use automated websites to do that, as it will take you years to complete one</li>
                </ol>
                 

             <h1>Automated Websites</h1>
             <ol>
                 <li>varvy</li>
                 <li>siteanalyzer !important</li>
             </ol>
